# Credits
This is my first attempt to build a Smart Contract and I've followed a project from Buildspace.so (truly an awesome space)
Shoutout to Buildspace community

# General Info
In this project, a user can 
1. Connect to their Wallet
2. Mint any NFT (The Office charchter) present in the project to fight against the Boss(Dwight) in 'SelectCharacter' component
3. Attack the Boss in the 'Arena' Region
4. When the NFT is minted, we can see this on OpenSea 
5. The NFT for Character and Boss has features like Attack Damage and Health Points that can be tracked in real-time on OpenSea
6. Once the Character's Health Points is depleated, it cannot attack the Boss :D

# Technologies Used
1. Solidity, 0.8.1
2. HardHat
3. React JS
4. Openzeppelin
5. Our Smart Contract inherits ERC721 
6. IPFS
7. Pinnata - Pinned the NFT Characters on Pinnata to get CDI

# What did I learn?
1. Learnt to write a Smart Contract (motivates me to write some more :P)
2. Wrote a ReactJS webapp for the FIRST TIME 
3. Learnt about IPFS and how it works
4. Learnt about Pinnata and Pinned some images from Google to be used as NFT Character for Game
5. Learnt that I need to watch some more series to make some funny games like these and learn a lot along the way!!!! ðŸ˜Š

PS: The WebApp has been made using Replit and not done locally
